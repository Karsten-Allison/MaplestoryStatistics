# MaplestoryStatistics

The infamous MMORPG Maplestory features multiple stochastic enhancement mechanisms for in-game items. Two of its enhancement systems, namely "Starforcing" and "Cubing", are subjected to randomness and cannot be calculated deterministically. As such, I developed a Python program that employs a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate and graph estimates for specific outcomes pertaining to these two enhancement systems.
